Headless CMSs (or is it CMSes or CMS's) are all the rage. And rightly so, because it makes sense to decouple your content from your website implementation. They come in all shapes and sizes, from free to expensive, from cloud based to self-hosted.

If you're going for a cloud option, [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com) <i class="icon style1 fa-external-link"></i> is a good one with a generous free tier. For a hosted CMS look no further than [Directus](https://getdirectus.com) <i class="icon style1 fa-external-link"></i>.
