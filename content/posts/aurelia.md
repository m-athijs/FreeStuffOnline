Client side Javascript frameworks are popping up like weed nowadays. And yes, if you do client side development, you probably need some kind of framework. Unless you want to get really masochistic about it and do all the tedious Javascript plumbing yourself.

But what framework to use? You can play it safe and use one of the popular frameworks everybody uses, like [AngularJS](https://angular.io) <i class="icon style1 fa-external-link"></i> or [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) <i class="icon style1 fa-external-link"></i> . Or you can try something new and potentially better, like [Aurelia](http://aurelia.io/) <i class="icon style1 fa-external-link"></i> . I'd go for the latter, if I were you.
